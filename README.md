# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut?** Delete this file. Have fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm test:e2e`        | Run Playwright tests in all responsive viewports |
| `pnpm test:e2e:ui`     | Open Playwright's interactive test runner        |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## End-to-end tests

`pnpm test:e2e` runs the same smoke and responsive checks against
`https://det.rg.foxbyte.de` in the locally installed Microsoft Edge at desktop,
tablet, and mobile viewport sizes. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` to target another
deployment. The tests cover the landing page, address search, selection of a
known building, the transition to the first data-entry step, horizontal
overflow, 200% user font sizing, Windows forced-colors mode, and automated
color-contrast checks. The generated HTML report and test artifacts are stored
in `playwright-report/` and `test-results/`.
